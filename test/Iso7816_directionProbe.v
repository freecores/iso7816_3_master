/*
Models a probe which consist only of wires. Propagation delay over the sio line
is used to determined the direction of the communication:
If the terminal send a start bit, the termMon output will go low before cardMon and viceversa:

                   sio line
Terminal ---------------------------------- Card
           |                            |
			  |                            |
			  termMon                      cardMon

Note for a physical implementation:
The difference between the delay "Terminal to termMon" and the delay "Card to cardMon"
should be kept small in comparison to the delay "Terminal to/from Card" (considering falling edge delay)

In this model, delays are 0 except the delay over the sio line.

/*****************************************************************
* module triwire: bidirectional wire bus model with delay
*
* This module models the two ends of a bidirectional bus with
* transport (not inertial) delays in each direction. The
* bus has a width of WIDTH and the delays are as follows:
* a->b has a delay of Ta_b (in `timescale units)
* b->a has a delay of Tb_a (in `timescale units)
* The two delays will typically be the same. This model
* overcomes the problem of "echoes" at the receiving end of the
* wire by ensuring that data is only transmitted down the wire
* when the received data is Z. That means that there may be
* collisions resulting in X at the local end, but X's are not
* transmitted to the other end, which is a limitation of the
* model. Another compromise made in the interest of simulation
* speed is that the bus is not treated as individual wires, so
* a Z on any single wire may prevent data from being transmitted
* on other wires.
*
* The delays are reals so that they may vary throughout the
* course of a simulation. To change the delay, use the Verilog
* force command. Here is an example instantiation template:
*
real Ta_b=1, Tb_a=1;
always(Ta_b) force triwire.Ta_b = Ta_b;
always(Tb_a) force triwire.Tb_a = Tb_a;
triwire #(.WIDTH(WIDTH)) triwire (.a(a),.b(b));
